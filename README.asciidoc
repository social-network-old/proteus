Proteus is an implementation of the link:{axolotl}[axolotl protocol] (later renamed to Double Ratchet Algorithm) without
header keys. It is suitable for use in asynchronous environments through its
use of link:{whisper}[prekeys].

The roles of the axolotl protocol for a particular session are fixed through
the use of prekeys:

    - The side that obtains a prekey and uses it to initiate a session
      is _Alice_.
    - The side that receives a prekey message and uses it to initiate a
      session is _Bob_.

All cryptographic primitives used in the implementation of the protocol are
provided by link:{sodium}[libsodium]:

    - Cipher: link:{chacha}[ChaCha20]
    - MAC: link:{hmac}[HMAC-SHA256]
    - Diffie-Hellman: link:{curve25519}[Curve25519]
    - KDF: link:{hkdf-rfc}[HKDF] (link:{hkdf-impl}[implementation])

For serialisation of messages, sessions and keys, link:{cbor}[CBOR] is used.
The precise serialisation format is described in the link:{wiki}[wiki].
